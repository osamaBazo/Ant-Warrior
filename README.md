## Intro
Ant Warrior is a University Project created by a group of students in their 3rd year at Damascus University.

## Technologies
* The game is built using Legacy OpenGL implemented using NEHE template.
* All Physics and Mathematics used were implemented and tested by us.

## Features
* The story of the game is that a bunch of ants invaded a computer and the player should destroy them all.
* Collision.
* Sounds.

## Setup
I advice you not to setup OpenGl on your computer and don't ever try to install itðŸ˜…, as it would take several days to do so.
